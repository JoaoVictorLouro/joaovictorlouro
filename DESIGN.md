## Brand & Style

This design system evolves the "Night City" aesthetic into a more atmospheric,
immersive experience. It captures the sensory overload of a rain-slicked Tokyo
alleyway, where high-tech interfaces meet the organic grit of the urban
underground. The brand personality is enigmatic, high-fidelity, and technically
sophisticated.

The design style combines **Glassmorphism** with **High-Contrast Bold**
elements. It utilizes deep, charcoal surfaces that serve as a void for vibrant,
multi-color neon glows and light-leak effects. The visual narrative is driven by
the reflection of light on wet surfaces, using gradients and blurs to simulate
the "bleeding" of neon signs into the surrounding environment. The mood is
cinematic, futuristic, and intentionally moody, evoking the feeling of a secure
terminal hidden within a glowing metropolis.

## Colors

The palette transition moves away from static pinks toward a dynamic,
light-emissive spectrum inspired by urban signage.

- **Primary (Glowing Cyan):** The dominant "signal" color. It represents active
  data streams, primary actions, and high-energy focal points.
- **Secondary (Lantern Amber/Yellow):** A warm contrast to the cool tech, used
  for warnings, critical alerts, and highlighted navigational elements.
- **Tertiary (Magenta/Violet):** Used for decorative accents, depth-building
  gradients, and status variations.
- **Surface:** The foundation is a near-black charcoal (`#08090A`). Surfaces are
  treated with subtle cool-toned gradients (moving from deep navy to charcoal)
  to mimic the diffused light of a rainy night.

**Neon Effects:** Every accent color must employ a "bloom" effect. Buttons and
active strokes should use multi-layered glows (outer shadows) that combine the
base hue with a broader, lower-opacity light leak.

## Typography

The system maintains a sharp, high-tech hierarchy.

**Sora** remains the display powerhouse. Headlines should feel structural and
heavy. For a "Night City" editorial feel, use `headline-xl` with a subtle
vertical gradient that transitions from a bright white to a faint cyan or
magenta tint.

**Hanken Grotesk** is used for all functional body text, ensuring legibility
against high-contrast backgrounds.

**JetBrains Mono** is the utility layer. It must be used for all
"metadata"—timestamps, coordinates, and system logs. Labels in this font should
often be rendered in all-caps to reinforce the terminal aesthetic.

## Layout & Spacing

The layout is a **Fixed Grid** system that emphasizes rigid horizontal and
vertical alignment, reflecting the structured architecture of a futuristic city.

- **The Grid:** A 12-column desktop grid with strict 24px gutters. Elements
  should align precisely to these gutters to maintain a "high-tech" feel.
- **The "Reflective" Margin:** On desktop, use wide 64px margins. The dead space
  in the margins should occasionally feature "light-leak" gradients (soft
  magenta or cyan blurs) that creep in from the edges of the screen, simulating
  off-screen neon signs.
- **Breakpoints:**
  - **Mobile (<768px):** 4-column grid, 16px margins.
  - **Tablet (768px - 1024px):** 8-column grid, 32px margins.
  - **Desktop (>1024px):** 12-column grid, 64px margins.

## Elevation & Depth

This system eschews traditional soft shadows for **Atmospheric Depth** and
**Vibrant Outlines**.

- **Tonal Layering:** Objects do not "cast" shadows; they "emit" light. Surfaces
  use deep, semi-transparent charcoal with `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` to
  create a frosted glass effect that picks up the background colors.
- **Light-Leak Overlays:** Use large, low-opacity radial gradients in the
  background to simulate "wet pavement" reflections. These should shift between
  Cyan, Magenta, and Amber as the user scrolls.
- **Edge Illumination:** Instead of elevation, use 1px inner borders. Top and
  left edges should use a brighter tint of the component's accent color, while
  bottom and right edges use a darker shade, creating a "specular highlight"
  effect.

## Shapes

The shape language is **Strictly Sharp (0px roundedness)**. Every component
should feel like a modular piece of hardware.

- **Clipped Geometry:** Use 45-degree chamfered corners on primary buttons and
  high-level containers.
- **Structural Brackets:** Frame important data or images with L-shaped corner
  "brackets" rather than full boxes. This minimizes visual bulk while
  maintaining a strong high-tech container metaphor.

## Components

### Buttons

- **Style:** Sharp-edged, high-vibrancy blocks.
- **Primary:** Background in `neon-teal`, text in `neutral-black`. Apply a
  `15px` outer glow in `neon-teal`.
- **Secondary:** Transparent background, `lantern-amber` 1px border. On hover,
  the border glows and the background fills with a 10% amber tint.

### Cards

- **Style:** Charcoal glass with a top-weighted gradient.
- **Accents:** A 2px "status stripe" on the left edge using a tertiary color
  (Magenta or Amber).
- **Reflection:** A subtle diagonal "sheen" (light-leak) should occasionally
  sweep across the card face on hover.

### Input Fields

- **Style:** Underline-only or full-border sharp rectangles. Use a monospace
  cursor that blinks with a `neon-teal` glow.
- **Focus:** The entire input area gains a subtle cyan light-leak background at
  5% opacity.

### Chips & Badges

- **Style:** Sharp, solid-color tags with black `JetBrains Mono` text.
- **Animation:** Important "System" chips should have a slight "flicker"
  animation, intermittently dropping opacity to 70% to mimic a failing neon
  sign.

### Navigation

- **Top Bar:** Fixed, 100% width, sharp bottom border. Use a "Data Stream"
  progress bar at the very top that pulses with cyan light as pages load.
